# Overview:
In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round we had to compare the weather information for the months of June and December in Oahu.

## Results:
In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0. Standard deviation is 3.26.



In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0. Standard deviation is 3.75.



## Summary:
December temperatures vary more than June temperatures. However, December is still appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream as the weather is still realitively warm.
