# Overview:
In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round we had to compare the weather information for the months of June and December in Oahu.

## Results:
In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0. Standard deviation is 3.26.

In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0. Standard deviation is 3.75.

## Summary:
December temperatures vary more than June temperatures. However, December is still appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream as the weather is still realitively warm.

To help decide whether they should build the shop other queries should also be run. For example, they should check the precipitation information to see whether their desired location gets enough sun for people to enjoy ice cream year round. They should also check information about the location they would like place the shop physically. They would need to see if that beach has good surfing conditions (wave swell, rip tides, etc).
